This repository contains solutions and notes related to my journey through competitive programming and data structures and algorithms (DSA). The resources are based on Kunal Kushwaha's DSA course and other problem-solving exercises.

## Overview
This repository is structured to include:
- **Code Solutions**: Implementations of various DSA topics and competitive programming problems.
- **Notes**: Concepts, tricks, and algorithms explained.
- **Topics Covered**: Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and more.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Competitive_Programming-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired topic folder.
3. Run the code or review the notes.
